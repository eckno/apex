                      (as defined below) greater than $4,999.99 are eligible for this cash offer. To
                       qualify, you must enroll your existing or new account (the “Account”) either by
                        entering the promotional code on your new account application, requesting to enroll,
                         via telephone, with a Apex Holdings Representative or by completing the enrollment form.
                          You must fund the Account with New Assets within 45 calendar days of Account enrollment.
                           New Assets is defined as cash or securities held at a financial institution other than
                            Apex Holdings (assets transferred from an existing Apex Holdings account do not qualify).
                              Your Account will not qualify for the cash offer if you withdraw or transfer assets from 
                              your Account, then redeposit them into the Account. New Assets will be aggregated during 
                              the 45-calendar day period following the enrollment date to determine the amount of your 
                              cash offer.  Apex Holdings will calculate your eligibility to receive a cash offer by adding 
                              all New Assets deposited or transferred into the Account during the Promotional Period, reduced
                               by any withdrawals or transfers from the Account during the 270-calendar day holding period
                                following the last day upon which you funded your Account with New Assets during the 
                                Promotional Period (“Qualifying Assets”).  Asset fluctuations (up or down) do not affect
                                 the calculation of Qualifying Assets.  The cash offer will be determined based on Qualifying
                                  Assets in the Account as follows: Less than $5,000 – cash reward of $0; $5,000 – $24,999 – 
                                  cash reward of $50; $25,000 – $99,999 – cash reward of $200; $100,000 – $199,999 – cash

                    <p class='h6'>** Options trading is not suitable for all investors. An option is a contract 
                        to buy or sell a specific financial product at a certain price on a certain date. Your 
                        account application to trade options will be considered and approved or disapproved based
                         on all relevant factors, including your trading experience. Automated trading, as it relates
                          to direct-access electronic placement and execution of equity options trades, requires manual
                           one-click verification before order is sent. Each leg of a multi-leg spread incurs a commission
                            and bid/ask cost that can be significant. A $14.95 fee applies for options exercises or assignments
                             at expiration. For early options exercises or assignments, a $1.50 per contract fee will apply, 
                             with a $5.95 minimum. An additional fee of $1.00 per contract will be applied to all index options
                              trades. There is an Options Regulatory Fee of $0.0431 per contract ($0.05 minimum) applicable to 
                              all options transactions. These costs will affect the profitability of all stock and options trades
                               and should be considered prior to making any trade. Please visit ecpfinance.org for a link to the
